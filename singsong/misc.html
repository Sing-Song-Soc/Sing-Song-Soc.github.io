<h3>Miscellaneous</h3>

<h2>Mascots</h2>
<p class="new">While we have never had a dedicated mascot, over the years we have treated various things as mascots. More <a href="mascots.html">here</a>.</p>

<h2>Glee Awards</h2>
<p class="old">
  Glee Awards have, from time to time, been distributed after concerts. This was always, in part, an affectation copied from the University Gilbert and Sullivan Society, and worked best in the days when there was an extensive shared membership, and we all knew the form. Traditionally a part of the P&P remit, in practice the awards would be administered by whoever felt best placed to do so. Masters of this art through the years include Mark Pim and Jess Price. They were a regular feature of concerts, at least between 2005-9.<br />
  <br />
  Awards were awarded for the first time in years at the <a href="../activities/concerts/2012christmas.html">Christmas 2012 concert</a>, and were a roaring success, making it highly probable that the tradition will be reborn.<br />
  <br />
  Since records were kept patchily at best, any archive will probably have to begin with the most recent set. The only other information to hand is a nice list of awards won by your humble archivist, and that would just look a bit self-serving, or possibly downright incriminating.<br />
  <br />
  <span class="new">Unfortunately all we have now are those Christmas 2012 awards, linked <a href="2012awards.html">here</a>.</span>
</p>

<h2>Old Website</h2>
<p class="old">The last website put in sterling service for a good few years, but isn't around anymore. On <a href="old-website.html">this page</a> are various bits and pieces salvaged from it.</p>

<h2>Gleechés</h2>
<p class="old">
  gleeché (n): Twee, infuriating but annoyingly catchy colloquial name for any item, vaguely related to the choir, formed by prefixing an ordinary and unsuspecting word with 'Glee-'. Or Gl-. Or, indeed G-. We're not fussy, or discriminate, or particularly tasteful at times.<br />
  <br />
  See <a href="gleeches.html">here</a> for a good list of old gleechés, circa ~2004. While most are now lost to the mists of time, it's still rather evocative. Plenty more have come and gone since, and they continue to variously amuse and infuriate, in about equal measure.<br />
</p>

<h2>Archive</h2>
<p class="old">There is something of a paper archive, although it isn't really well organised at the moment. It consists of, among other things, various old society constitutions, membership lists and inventories, a random selection of minutes and a few posters/programmes.</p>
<p class="new">It is unclear how much (if any) of this is still around.</p>

<h2>P&P File</h2>
<p class="old">
  There used to exist a large folder containing numerous examples of posters and programmes, as well as all the bits and pieces to make up a nice Freshers' Fair stall. Sadly, it disappeared after a rehearsal in Physics at some point around Christmas 2011, and it remains vanishingly unlikely that it will ever turn up again.<br />
  <br />
  At around the same time, Glee received an intriguing parcel, containing fascinating archive-type material. We don't know from whence it came, and sadly, we don't know where it went either, because at almost the same time we lost our P&P folder, we lost the package, in almost the exact same manner, before any time could be given to scrutinise it's contents. We held some hope for it's return, for it was a box with our address on it, but no such luck. Needless to say, the loss of both these items makes the current attempt to archive quite a bit harder than it might have been. If anyone reading this knows who sent it, and what it might have contained, please say.
</p>

<h2>Library</h2>
<p class="old">The Glee music library is a big collection of sheet music and books that currently live, for the most part, in Music Practice Room 4, round the back of old Langwith. It's in a bit of a state at the moment - no up to date record of what we have, and it's in a big, badly sorted pile. Still, nothing we can't fix with a bit of effort.</p>
<p class="new">Our sheet music collection was recently organised by Chris Jacobs, one of our current librarians, in preparation for the move of storage to Biology.</p>

<h2>Surprise/Emergency Piece</h2>
<p class="old">A tradition in Glee since Anna became MD, this involves introducing an entirely new (and pretty simple) piece to the choir at the last possible rehearsal. Initially, this was more or less about bulking out a concert in a last minute panic, but it has evolved more into a device to force as many people as possible to turn up to the last rehearsal.</p>
<p class="new">This has not happened in recent memory.</p>
