<h3>Miscellaneous</h3>

<h2>Glee Awards</h2>
<p class="old">
  Glee Awards have, from time to time, been distributed after concerts. This was always, in part, an affectation copied from the University Gilbert and Sullivan Society, and worked best in the days when there was an extensive shared membership, and we all knew the form. Traditionally a part of the P&P remit, in practice the awards would be administered by whoever felt best placed to do so. Masters of this art through the years include Mark Pim and Jess Price. They were a regular feature of concerts, at least between 2005-9.<br />
  <br />
  Awards were awarded for the first time in years at the <a href="../activities/concerts/2012christmas.html">Christmas 2012 concert</a>, and were a roaring success, making it highly probable that the tradition will be reborn.<br />
  <br />
  Since records were kept patchily at best, any archive will probably have to begin with the most recent set. The only other information to hand is a nice list of awards won by your humble archivist, and that would just look a bit self-serving, or possibly downright incriminating.<br />
  <br />
  <span class="new">Unfortunately all we have now are those Christmas 2012 awards, linked <a href="2012awards.html">here</a>.</span>
</p>

<h2>Gleechés</h2>
<p class="old">
  gleeché (n): Twee, infuriating but annoyingly catchy colloquial name for any item, vaguely related to the choir, formed by prefixing an ordinary and unsuspecting word with 'Glee-'. Or Gl-. Or, indeed G-. We're not fussy, or discriminate, or particularly tasteful at times.<br />
  <br />
  See <a href="gleeches.html">here</a> for a good list of old gleechés, circa ~2004. While most are now lost to the mists of time, it's still rather evocative. Plenty more have come and gone since, and they continue to variously amuse and infuriate, in about equal measure.<br />
