<h3>How to run Sing Song Society</h3>

<p class="new">This is a handy list of most things that need doing to keep the society ticking, if anything needs adding let me know.</p>

<h2>Every Week</h2>
<p class="new"><b>Rehearsals</b> - we rehearse Wednesday 19:00-21:30, with an all day rehearsal the week before the concert and sometimes an extended rehearsal the Wednesday before. The MD generally leads the rehearsal, and the librarians make sure all equipment and music is brought to rehearsal and put back.</p>
<p class="new"><b><a href="../activities/socials.html">Socials</a></b> - we try to do a social every week, organised and ran by the social sec. We also do a post concert meal after every concert.</p>
<p class="new"><b>Emails</b> - the Secretary sends out emails with everything members need to know about the coming week (i.e. rehearsals, socials, etc.).</p>
<p class="new"><b>P&P</b> - it is important that we publicise things that we are doing, such as concerts or socials. This is generally done through the instagram, which is run by P&P. P&P also designs and prints programmes for the concerts.</p>
<p class="new"><b>Printing music</b> - librarians print music that is needed for rehearsals.</p>

<h2>Every "Term"</h2>
<p class="new">While terms don't really exist anymore, for the time being we do still work around them.</p>
<p></p>
<p class="new"><b><a href="../activities/concerthome.html">Putting on a concert</a></b> - this is the main thing every "term" builds to, usually on a Sunday from 4pm with the choir coming in to practice at 2pm. We showcase the songs we have been learning this term and any solos/small group numbers members want to do.</p>
<p class="new"><b>Booking rooms</b> - done by the Secretary, this is both for rehearsals and concerts (and anything else), we try to make sure all rooms are as accessible as possible (and often have to "fight" room bookings to do so).</p>
<p class="new"><b>Sourcing music</b> - the MD is in charge of finding or arranging songs for each concert. If the MD approves, other members may also arrange and/or teach songs.</p>
<p class="new"><b><a href="../activities/otherperformances.html">Other performances</a></b> - we prepare and put on any other performances we agree to do.</p>

<h2>Every Year</h2>
<p class="new"><b>Freshers' Fair</b> - it is important to get new people into the society, and freshers' fair is a great way to do it. We run a stall for the day, advertising ourselves to freshers, and also put on a small performance.</p>
<p class="new"><b><a href="../activities/residentials.html">Residentials</a></b> - every year we put on a residential, usually run by the president. It's a great opportunity to go somewhere fun and get to know your fellow sing songers a bit better.</p>
<p class="new"><b>AGM</b> - every year we have our Annual General Meeting, where we hold elections for every committee role.</p>
<p class="new"><b>Re-ratification</b> - after our AGM, the new committee has to get together to re-ratify the society with YorkSU. This involves going through the constitution and rewriting anything that needs changing, and just generally planning for the year ahead. Members of the previous committee are usually invited to help out.</p>
<p class="new"><b>Merch</b> - in recent years we have offered green committee hoodies, and also have done one order of navy blue hoodies and other items that was open to all members of the society.</p>
