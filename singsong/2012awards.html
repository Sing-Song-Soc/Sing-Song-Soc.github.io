<h3>Xmas '12 Awards</h3>

<p class="old">
  The Autumn/Christmas term 2012 saw the first set of Glee Awards awarded for several years. Thanks to the good socials, excellent turnout, successful residential and general good feeling, it was felt that the barriers to giving successful awards (mainly: nobody being able to remember anyone else's name) had been overcome.<br />
  Being almost the only person around who could remember the process, Stuart Roberts sorted everything out and presented the awards at the Deramore after the concert.<br />
  <br />
  <b>Most Gleeful</b> : Caroline Waever<br />
  Entirely appropriate award for our newly elected Chair, refreshing and cheerful all term.<br />
  <br />
  <b>Most Christmassy</b> : Craig Perkinton<br />
  Not only led the carols with verve, but also quite a sight busking in a flimsy Santa suit. Still not convinced by the beard.<br />
  <br />
  <b>Friendliest Person</b> : Lucy Pell-Walpole<br />
  The award with the most people nominated, clearly a very friendly lot. Deserved victory for Lucy, Glee veteran and heart of the alto section.<br />
  <br />
  <b>Loudest Person</b> : Stuart Roberts<br />
  What it says on the tin, really. Not necessarily correct, but enthusiastic and piercing, and still not entirely sure what a pp marking actually means.<br />
  <br />
  <b>Best Section</b> : Alto<br />
  The biggest section, but run surprisingly close in the vote by the basses. The award was presented to a representative of the section, in this case Suzie Ricketts.<br />
  <br />
  <b>Best Song</b> : The Snow<br />
  The obvious choice, the musical and emotional core of the concert. Much praise to our excellent violinists, and Liz took this award on their behalf.<br />
  <br />
  <b>Best Soloist</b> : Lucy Davies<br />
  Tight race, Lucy's impressive gospel in 'All I Want…' just pipping Lorna's beautiful 'I'll Be There' after a late surge.<br />
  <br />
  <b>Best Newcomer</b> : Ben Oppedijk<br />
  Enthusiastic and cheerful, made a great contribution to the choir and at the residential, and a welcome addition to the new committee.<br />
  <br />
  <b>Biggest Blunder</b> : Amy Smith/Liz Bramhall/Nick Harbourne<br />
  Referencing an event at the residential, where Amy and Liz contrived between them to leave Nick on a train. More details <a href="../activities/residentials/2012residential.html">here</a>. As the suffering party, Nick claimed the award.<br />
  <br />
  <b>Best Drunk</b> : James Taylor<br />
  Another award marking the contribution of the residential to fun this term. As well as gin, wine and rum.<br />
  <br />
