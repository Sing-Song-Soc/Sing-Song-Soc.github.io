<h3>History</h3>

      <h2>1989 - New Beginnings</h2>
      <p class="old">Four members of the University of York Gilbert & Sullivan Society, led by a visiting American student, Erik Contzius, founded a barbershop quartet. The founding members were Erik Contzius (Baritone), Jeremy Lowe (Bass), Mark Broomfield (Tenor 1), and Christopher Brenner (Tenor 2).</p>
      <p class="old">At first, we shared many traditions (and members!) with G&S. Our original constitution was based on theirs, and for several years people who joined both societies paid reduced membership fees.</p>

    <div class="content">
      <h2>"Mid-Nineties" - Becoming Unique</h2>
      <p class="old">Glee's unique identity began to emerge in the mid-Nineties, however, when for three years we became probably the world's only combined choir and Cephalopod Appreciation Society. (It's a long story.)<a id="fn-1-ref" aria-label="Footnote 1." href="#fn-1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
    </div>

  <div class="container">
    <div class="content">
      <h2>1997 - Musical Time!</h2>
      <p class="old">In association with DramaSoc, we produced a full-length musical comedy, written by us. As well as this, for seven years<a id="fn-2-ref" aria-label="Footnote 2." href="#fn-2"><sup>2</sup></a> we toured local primary schools with a short musical, the last four of which were written by ourselves</p>
    </div>

    <div class="content">
      <h2>1998 - Rebranding</h2>
      <p class="old">Initially known as the "Glee Club" following American tradition, in 1998 we became York Glee Singers because most people didn't realise we were a choir.</p>

    <div class="content">
      <h2>2002 - The Glee CD</h2>
      <p class="new">Glee records a full-length studio CD, more can be found on this <a href="../activities/glee-cd.html">here</a>.</p>

      <h2>2010 - 20th Anniversary Celebration</h2>
      <p class="old">Or if you must - <b>Gleeunion 2010!</b></p>
      <p class="old">19th-20th June 2010</p>
      <p class="old">A few of us gathered to celebrate what was, more or less, 20th anniversary of the choir, sang some songs, had a lovely meal out and generally reminisced. Much fun was had by all.<a id="fn-3-ref" aria-label="Footnote 3." href="#fn-3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>

      <h2>2019 - Rebranding, again</h2>
      <p class="new">Goodbye York Glee Singers, hello Sing Song Soc. The change happened between the Spring and Summer concerts and was prompted by, once again, people not thinking we're a choir. (Thanks Glee (2009))<a id="fn-4-ref" aria-label="Footnote 4." href="#fn-4"><sup>4</sup></a></p>

      <h2>2020 - The 30th AnniversaGLEE concert</h2>
      <p class="old">The Sing Song Soc Spring 2020 concert took place in the University of York Central Hall, at 7.30pm, on Thursday 14th March.</p>
      <p class="old">The concert was a celebration of the choir's anniversary - '<a href="../activities/concerts/2020spring.html">The 30th AnniversaGLEE concert</a>'! The programme was a selection of old favourites from previous concerts (obviously, skewing a bit more recent) and a few pieces to represent the decades the choir has been running.</p>

      <h2>2024 - Sing Song on BBC Radio 1</h2>
      <p class="new">On the 26th of September 2024, Greg James came to Central Hall to hold a <a href="../activities/longboi.html">funeral for a duck</a>. We sang a parody of Chappell Roan's HOT TO GO (L-O-N-G B-O-I) and See You Again by Wiz Khalifa, both live on BBC Radio 1. It is one of the silliest things I've ever had the pleasure of being part of.</p>
