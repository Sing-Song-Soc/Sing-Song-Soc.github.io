<h2 class="old">History</h2>
<p class="old">
York Glee Singers has been around, under various names, for a good while now. For those of you who're historically-minded, this page gives a summary of what kinds of things we've been up to in our eleven-year history.<br />
<br />
<b>Early Years</b><br />
<br />
In 1989, four members of the University of York Gilbert & Sullivan Society, led by a visiting American student, Erik Contzius, founded a barbershop quartet. The founding members were Erik Contzius (Baritone), Jeremy Lowe (Bass), Mark Broomfield (Tenor 1), and Christopher Brenner (Tenor 2).<br />
<br />
At first, we shared many traditions (and members!) with G&S. Our original constitution was based on theirs, and for several years people who joined both societies paid reduced membership fees. Glee's unique identity began to emerge in the mid-Nineties, however, when for three years we became probably the world's only combined choir and Cephalopod Appreciation Society. (It's a long story.)<br />
<br />
<b>Still going strong</b><br />
<br />
Fifteen (and counting!) years later, we're still going. Initially known as the "Glee Club" following American tradition, in 1998 we became York Glee Singers because most people didn't realise we were a choir.<br />
<br />
We have always given a Christmas concert in the Sir Jack Lyons Concert Hall, jointly with the University Concert Band. This was initially for the benefit of St Leonard's Hospice, and raising money for deserving charities is another long-standing tradition. In former years, we indulged in various non-choral activities: for seven years we toured local primary schools with a short musical, the last four of which were written by ourselves. In 1997, in association with DramaSoc, we produced a full-length musical comedy, also written by us. On a lighter note, we were stalwart participants in Langwith bar quiz for many years!<br />
<br />
<b>Today and the future</b><br />
<br />
Today, the choir is thriving, with upwards of fifty members and an increasingly full concert schedule. We have been invited to return to virtually every venue we've performed at in the last few years, and our repertoire is increasingly challenging and ambitious. We have also recently recorded our first full-length studio CD, and been awarded an outstanding adjudication in a national competition. We manage this on only 30 hours' rehearsal time per term, and retaining our principle of welcoming all new members and holding no auditions!<br />
<br />
From modest roots, Glee has grown into one of the most successful choirs in York, while never losing sight of its original aims: to make music available to everyone, to make music fun, and to make music!<br />
