  “I’ve been singing in choirs for as long as I can remember, both at school and a couple of community choirs too. When I went to uni I didn’t want to stop, so I went along to a rehearsal of the “Sing Song Society” to see what it was like. They struck me as a group of lovely people just singing for fun, which is basically what I’d been doing all my life anyway, so I stuck around! Apart from anything else, they’d also got me hook-line-and-sinker with some of the epic tunes we learned for my first concert “cosy under the covers” like The 12 days of christmas. Boy did we smash that concert!<br />
  <br />
  I ran for librarian in 2023 because I thought the job description of: “Print the music and carry the keyboard each week” seemed easy enough, and because I realised that we were in a bit of a lurch, after the rather sudden departure of the old librarians. Also, when it came to organising our belongings for the storage move, I was quite happy to adopt the task of cataloguing all our music; I like a bit of logistics and keeping things organised, and I’m quite proud of how efficient our system is now!<br />
  <br />
  I also ran for AMD in 2023 because I’ve done a little bit of conducting in the past and quite enjoy it. I also thought myself fairly knowledgeable musically having done GCSE and A-level, so I hoped I could contribute something to the MD team, even if it was just suggesting some new warm-ups! Composition courseworks at A-level sadly ruined my relationship with musescore, so I’ve never managed to bring myself to arrange anything from scratch for the choir to do. But, I do enjoy challenging myself to improve my conducting skills, by taking the lead on teaching and conducting at least one piece each term, especially if there are any that someone else has arranged, but doesn’t want to teach/conduct. My one future desire that I have regarding the set-lists is to lead an arrangement of my favourite Christmas song O Holy Night in my last winter concert (2025). Here’s hoping that comes to fruition!<br />
  <br />
  I’m so pleased I joined Sing-Song, as time’s gone on I’ve just had great experience after great experience with them, like singing a childhood legend of mine at the 2024 summer concert (The Monarchs song, I’m a history student, that tune basically defines me) and not to mention singing on Radio bloody 1! I mean…. what?!?!?! How often do you get to do that???? How could I NOT enjoy Sing Song!” (Nov 2024)<br />
