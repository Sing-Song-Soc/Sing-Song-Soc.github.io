  <b>Sing Song Member</b>: 2021-2025<br />
  <br />
  <b>Committee Roles</b><br />
  Secretary: 2022-2024<br />
  <br />
  "I have always had a love of singing and performing, but I've never had a choir that was so special and meaningful to me as Sing Song Society. I initially joined as a fresher who wanted to sing some Christmas carols, and I stayed for the incredible people and friends I had made - and to keep the society running as its Secretary!<br />
  <br />
  There are so many brilliant memories associated with Sing Song Soc - marching onstage in full Village People gear to do the YMCA, trying to keep a straight face during It's Raining Men while <a href="briancourtehoute.html">Brian</a> goes ham on the kazoo behind me, and going to the club decked out in the most horrendous pieces from charity shops.<br />
  <br />
  But whether I'm making an absolute fool of myself by learning a BTS dance for Dynamite, or solemnly parodying Chappell Roan in memorial to a duck, I always give my all. Because at the end of the day, this society brings so much joy to myself and others, so you have to commit to the silliness!"<br />
