  <b>Sing Song Member</b>: 2021-2024<br />
  <br />
  <b>Committee Roles</b><br />
  Press & Publicity: 2022-2024<br />
  Social Secretary: 2022-2023<br />
  <br />
  "I joined Sing Song Society as a naive Fresher in October 2021, originally worrying that I wouldn't make friends and that everyone would be way more talented than me. What I found was a group of incredibly fun, talented and welcoming people who have all left a mark on me. A split second decision to run for Press and Publicity Officer in the 2022-2023 committee led to some of the best experiences of my life, and I'm so happy that for 2 years I was able to contribute to the society.<br />
  <br />
  I don't think I could even begin to describe all my favourite moments because there are so many. My favourite thing overall is the people: we came together to sing but it turned into so much more. I built my confidence both as a singer and a person and I truly believe that in the hardest times of my degree, Sing Song Soc and the friends I've made were huge influences in getting me through. Getting to spend time with some of them more closely on the 2024 residential made me even more certain of how strongly we all care for each other.<br />
  <br />
  In the end, we're just a silly bunch having fun singing together and supporting each other, and I think that's amazing! Though I left York in the summer of 2024, I will always consider myself a part of Sing Song Soc &lt;3"<br />
