<h2>Legacy Roles</h2>
<p>Below is a list of previous roles that are not currently in use.</p>

<p class="old"><b>Chair</b> - Chairs meetings, obviously. Almost everything else can be delegated to someone else if you want. Traditionally, has contacted and negotiated with concert venues. Usually the main point of contact with St Mary's in Cottonstones, and is theoretically in charge over all of the weekend away. Keeps an eye on the committee and makes sure everything that needs to be done is being done by someone. Above all else, the friendly face of Glee, and our leader, although the amount of speeches necessary is entirely negotiable.</p>
<p class="old"><b>Webmaster</b> - Deals mainly with websites.</p>
<p class="old"><b>Merchandise</b> - Deals mainly with merchandise.</p>
<p class="old"><b>Ordinary Member</b> - Deals with anything else. Booking rooms, moving things about, all sorts of things, especially if any of the other positions are currently unfilled.</p>
<p class="new"><b>Feedback Officer</b> - In charge of polls and unspecific society queries and checks our rehearsals, concerts and socials work well in an Equality, Diversity and Inclusion (EDI) lens. Preferably held by a new member so we have a committee voice directly telling us what might be confusing for a new member.</p>

<h2>Legacy Descriptions</h2>
<p>Below is a list of role descriptions for current roles that were taken from the wikidot.</p>

<p class="old"><b>Secretary</b> - Deals mainly with communication. In charge of keeping an up to date membership list and maintaining the e-mail list. Generally deals with the e-mail account - responding to queries etc. Sends all messages out to the choir: rehearsal schedule, various reminders about concerts and socials etc. (remember to use BCC). Keeps minutes in committee, so nobody can complain later.</p>
<p class="old"><b>Treasurer</b> - Deals mainly with money. Takes in membership money and deals with money at concerts. Makes sure people who are owed money get it. Sorts out grant applications and generally deals with YUSU finance.</p>
<p class="old"><b>MD</b> - Deals mainly with music.</p>
<p class="old"><b>AMD</b> - See MD, but slightly less so.</p>
<p class="old"><b>Librarian</b> - Deals mainly with bits of paper. Generally responsible for making sure there is sufficient music around to have a successful rehearsal. This can involve a lot of printing/photocopying, and shifting a lot of paper around. Responsible for making sure that, in time for any performance, there is enough of the appropriate music in enough folders for everyone to sing from. Also is supposed to keep an eye on the larger music library. I would say 'keep it organised and have up-to-date records' but at the moment it would be more a case of 'do something about our really big pile(s) of unsorted music'.</p>
<p class="old"><b>P&P</b> - Deals mainly with publicity. Designing and printing posters and concert programmes. The creating and distributing masses of posters element has taken something of a back seat to word of mouth/Facebook advertising, but you can always do with a few posters. Anything else you can come up with that counts as 'publicity'. Also, usually takes care of Glee Awards if we decide to have them, and if there is no Merch. Officer, takes control of the merchandise order.</p>
<p class="old"><b>Social Secretary</b> - Deals mainly with socials. Get a good idea of what sort of social the choir wants to do, and arrange it.</p>
