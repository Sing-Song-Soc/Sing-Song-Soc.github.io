<p class="new">Hi, this is Freya talking to you from the 10th of November 2024.<br />
    Last night me and my wonderful partner Maddie uploaded (hopefully) every page in the <a href="http://yorkgleesingers.wikidot.com/">old wikidot page</a> to the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20241109202750/http://yorkgleesingers.wikidot.com/">Wayback Machine</a>.<br />
    Now work begins on securing the legacy of that site and all the work Stuart put in by creating this new archive that will (hopefully) be kept up to date for many years to come.
</p>
<p class="new">I will be doing my best to include everything that was on the old site, no matter how out of date (this is an archive after all!).<br />
    To distinguish between my own additions and Stuart's original work I will be italicising everything originally written by Stuart, with that information here's the original introduction:
</p>
<p class="old">
Hi, welcome to the Glee Singers Archive! <br />
<br />
We will be starting with items dredged from backup copies of the old website (sadly missed), what constitutes of the paper archive, and whatever we can find lying around.<br />
In time, the site should contain as complete a picture as possible of who was in the choir and what they were singing down the years. At the moment it's mostly lists, eventually we'll bring in photos and as much comment and reminiscence as anyone cares to add.<br />
In addition, a brief series of things that probably need to be done each term/year to keep Glee ticking over, as well as some hints as to what work each committee post might entail.<br />
If we dare to dream, it might contain something worth looking at by the choir's 25th anniversary in 2014/15 <a id="fn-1-ref" aria-label="Footnote 1." href="#fn-1"><sup>1</sup></a>.<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />
Stuart Roberts<br />
(Glee Singer 2005-<span class="new">2021</span>, Chairman 2007)

    I hope you enjoy this new site, I will do my best to create an archive that would make Stuart proud.<br />
