<p>Hi, this is Freya talking to you from the 10th of November 2024. Last night me and my wonderful partner Maddie uploaded (hopefully) every page in the <a href="http://yorkgleesingers.wikidot.com/">old wikidot page</a> to the <a href="http://yorkgleesingers.wikidot.com/">Wayback Machine</a>. Now work begins on securing the legacy of that site and all the work Stuart put in by creating this new archive that will (hopefully) be kept up to date for many years to come.</p>
