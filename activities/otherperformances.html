<h3>Other Performances</h3>

<p class="new">The main concert is always the focus, but here is a collection of other performances we've done over the years.</p>

<h2>Busking/Caroling</h2>
<p class="old">Around Christmastime, Glee delights in finding excuses to go carolling. This often takes the form of just finding a spot in town and singing at passers by, but we are also invited to perform for various events.<br />
  <br />
  From 2012-14, we were invited to sing at the Ice Factor ice ring, at the York Designer Outlet, in return for free skating, which went down very well, at least with those of us more at home on the ice.<br />
  <br />
  Christmas 2014 & 2015 found us singing at events in York on behalf of SASH, a York homelessness charity.
</p>

<h2 class="new">Borders - 3rd December 2008</h2>
<p class="old">
  - On the evening of 3/12, Glee were invited to sing carols at Borders, at an event to mark the publishing of a new JK Rowling book. A good number of us gathered and sang and were rewarded with book tokens. After the concert, the choir were treated to a selection of books bought with the proceeds.<br />
  - We enjoyed working with the Borders people so much that we went back in a few times that term in smaller groups to sing and collect for charity.
</p>

<h2 class="new">Goodricke College Opening - 28th April 2010</h2>
<p class="old">
  - At the beginning of the term, we had a treat: Glee were invited to perform at the official opening of the new Goodricke college at Hes East.<br />
  - A small delegation sang 'Don't It Make My Brown Eyes Blue' for a selection of dignitaries (including HRH Prince Andrew) on the morning of Wednesday 28th April.<br />
  - The invitation was the result of the strong relationship between MD Anna Stephenson and the college administration.<br />
  - The lucky volunteers were Laurent Michaux, Stuart Roberts, Lucy Davies, Clare Rainsford, Katie Privett and Rachel Haynes, led by Anna Stephenson.<br />
  - A good time was had by all, and we liked the song so much we sang it again in the coming term's concert.<br />
  <span class="new">- An archived version of a York Vision article about the event can be found <a href="https://www.yorkvision.co.uk/archived/prince-andrew-officially-opens-new-goodricke-college/28/04/2010">here</a>, unfortunately there are no longer any pictures.<br />
  - The video linked to on the wikidot leads to the University of York 404 page so this appears to have been lost :(</span>
</p>

<h2 class="new">St Leonard's Hospice Christmas Fair - 4th December 2010</h2>
<p class="new">
  - There is a <a href="https://www.yorkpress.co.uk/news/8630746.york-glee-singers-to-perform-at-st-leonards-hospice-christmas-fair/">York Press article</a> about the event.
</p>

<h2 class="new">Celebrate York - 12th May 2012</h2>
<p class="old">
  - A lovely little festival, held by YUSU in Hull Road Park for a few years (2012-13, IIRC) near the start of the Summer term.<br />
  - A great day out lounging in the sun with a big picnic, getting your face painted and listening to a great range of student performers.<br />
  - The first time, at least. In 2013, it rained quite a bit, but that didn't stop us sitting in the rain enjoying a picnic.<br />
  <span class="new">- There was a Nouse article linked, but this no longer exists :(</span>
</p>

<h2 class="new">York Carnival - 16th June 2012</h2>
<p class="old">
  - City centre festival, to which Glee are usually invited.<br />
  <span class="new">- This doesn't appear to exist anymore, not much information about it online.</span>
</p>

<h2 class="new">Woodstock - 23rd June 2012</h2>
<p class="old">
  - The University's on campus music festival, held towards the end of Summer term. Glee are usually invited to perform on the indoor stage, and have done so on a few occasions if enough of us can make it.<br />
  - If invited, try to avoid the earliest slot (noonish), as there won't be anyone around to listen and the tech will still be a bit wonky. Even so, any performance practice before the concert is helpful.<br />
  <span class="new">- This also doesn't exist anymore, the last one appears to have been in 2015.</span>
</p>
