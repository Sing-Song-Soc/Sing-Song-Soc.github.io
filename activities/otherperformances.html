<h3>Other Performances</h3>

<h2 class="new">Borders - 3rd December 2008</h2>
<p class="old">
  - On the evening of 3/12, Glee were invited to sing carols at Borders, at an event to mark the publishing of a new JK Rowling book. A good number of us gathered and sang and were rewarded with book tokens. After the concert, the choir were treated to a selection of books bought with the proceeds.<br />
  - We enjoyed working with the Borders people so much that we went back in a few times that term in smaller groups to sing and collect for charity.

<h2 class="new">Goodricke College Opening - 28th April 2010</h2>
<p class="old">
  - At the beginning of the term, we had a treat: Glee were invited to perform at the official opening of the new Goodricke college at Hes East.<br />
  - A small delegation sang 'Don't It Make My Brown Eyes Blue' for a selection of dignitaries (including HRH Prince Andrew) on the morning of Wednesday 28th April.<br />
  - The invitation was the result of the strong relationship between MD Anna Stephenson and the college administration.<br />
  - The lucky volunteers were Laurent Michaux, Stuart Roberts, Lucy Davies, Clare Rainsford, Katie Privett and Rachel Haynes, led by Anna Stephenson.<br />
  - A good time was had by all, and we liked the song so much we sang it again in the coming term's concert.<br />
  <span class="new">- An archived version of a York Vision article about the event can be found <a href="https://www.yorkvision.co.uk/archived/prince-andrew-officially-opens-new-goodricke-college/28/04/2010">here</a>, unfortunately there are no longer any pictures.<br />
  - The video linked to on the wikidot leads to the University of York 404 page so this appears to have been lost :(</span>
