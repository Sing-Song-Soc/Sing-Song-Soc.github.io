  For this residential we went to Berwick-upon-Tweed, near the Scottish border. We stayed at Haven, split between two caravans. Day one was mostly travelling independently to Berwick, followed by a slightly disastrous BBQ attempt for dinner.<br />
  On day two we went to Heatherslaw Light Railway, travelling to Etal castle and the cutesy surrounding town, having a quick wander (/browse of the shop) before heading back. Back at Haven we made pizzas of varying qualities.<br />
  Day three we got the train to Edinburgh, splitting off into groups to explore before meeting up for Nandos before the train to Berwick. Day four we split off into groups yet again but this time around Berwick, with fajitas as our evening meal. Day five was quite an early checkout with people filtering out on different trains.
