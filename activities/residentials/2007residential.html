<h3>Residential 2007</h3>

<p class="old">
  The residential took place from Friday 22nd - Sunday 24th June 2007.<br />
  <br />
  In attendance were:<br />
  Stuart Roberts, James Gaughan, Michael Houston, Mark Pim, Valentin Mahrwald, Michael Sanders, Matthew Ferguson, Christine Lees, Jade Bailey, Jackie Smithers, Sally Rowe, Jess Price, Esme Wise. Led by Fiona Constantine as MD.<br />
  <br />
  We went with the intention of learning and performing an Ode to St. Cecilia (Finzi). Well, that was the idea, anyway.<br />
  What eventually occurred, after a great deal of effort and a greater deal of drink, was the discovery that the piece was beyond our capacity in just a few days. Instead, we treated St. Mary's to a selection of pieces from our Summer concert, some impressive and fitting, some a bit trite and incongruous, which, fortunately, were still in the boot of Mike's car. Including, IIRC, The 3 Minute Messiah, Stainer's I Saw The Lord and Old MacDonald.<br />
  The service, which had been devised around the theme of St Cecilia, proceeded, but I cannot claim the church was overly impressed with us.<br />
  <br />
  On the plus side - an enjoyable lock-in, and the joys of 'quiet pottle' and the inappropriate caterpillar.
